<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a dedicated IT professional with over 11 years of experience in the tech industry. 
  Originally from Hungary, I’ve been living and working in Germany for the past six years. 
  I completed both my high school and university education in Hungary, where I also began my career.</p>

<p>My professional journey started in network engineering, 
  where I developed a strong technical foundation. 
  Later, I moved into management roles, leading teams and projects, 
  and gaining valuable experience in coordination, planning, 
  and strategic thinking.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve found a new passion in web development. 
  I'm currently expanding my skills in this area, 
  driven by a strong interest in building modern, 
  user-friendly applications. 
  I see this as the next step in my career and a great opportunity to 
  combine my technical background with creative problem-solving.</p>

  <p>I’m always eager to learn, grow, 
    and take on new challenges—especially those that allow me to 
    create real value through technology.</p>
